# 🫐 BLEU score
University lab on the BLEU score

##
This is a lab work for a Multilingual NLP class where we had to, among other things, implement the bleu metric for machine translation from scratch, in order to get a better understanding of it. 

The questions are available [here](https://github.com/lina-conti/bleu/blob/main/tp_eval.pdf) and my answers [here](https://github.com/lina-conti/bleu/blob/main/Conti_Mult_Lab_3.pdf).
